Installation toolchain for a stock ubuntu 16.04 image:

  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-mixer-dev
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/meson
  sudo apt update; sudo apt dist-upgrade
  sudo apt install meson

Build your meson files:

cd into your base directory
  meson . builddir/

Do the build:

  cd builddir/
  ninja

That's about it, you can find the resulting binary in ./dungeons-of-daggorath/builddir/src

I just copy that up to the top level, so it finds the sounds, conf and saved directories.
